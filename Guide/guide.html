                Bathing your dog when needed is an important part of general pet
                care. For dogs with healthy skin and a healthy coat, the most
                common reason to bathe is to remove an unpleasant odour or
                because they’ve accumulated dirt on their coat.
                <br><br>
                The benefits of bathing can include cleaning the skin and coat which
                helps to remove loose hair, scale and debris and improve the hair
                coat’s shine.

Your local veterinary clinic can provide advice
about the mostsuitable products for your pet dog.
Choose a shampoo specificallydesigned for dogs.
Dogs have sensitive skin and their skin pH
isdifferent to the pH of human skin so human
shampoo productsshould not be used on dogs.<br/>
For dogs with healthy skin and coat,
choose a mild and gentlehypoallergenic
shampoo. For dogs with skin conditions your local vetcan
advise what type of shampoo or product to use to help manage

        <p class="wherep">
 For some dogs it can be easiest to bathe them outside in the<br>
 backyard on the ground. This way, owners can avoid lifting,<br>
 particularly medium to large-sized dogs. This can also be a good<br>
 option for dogs who try to jump out of the tub.<br/><br/>
Some owners choose to use a garden hose set on low pressure.
Always test the temperature of the hose water as in summer the
water can be quite hot at first, so you’ll need to wait until it cools
down before using it. If the weather’s cooler it may be necessary
to use buckets filled with comfortable, warm water instead as
the hose water may be too cold           
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2"><i class="fa fa-paw "></i>Bath tub/dog tub</h2>
        <p class="wherep">
For other dogs a bathtub or a dog tub may be suitable. Observe your pet, if they seem upset you might like to try outdoor
bathing instead<br>.If you’re using a tub always directly supervise your dog and be present with them. Let the water run down
the drain so the water doesn’t fill up the tub. This is important for safety reasons as dogs can drown.<br>Using a hose/shower
head attached to the tub is ideal or you may need to use containers/buckets of water and a ladle if you don’t have a hose/
shower attachment. Test the water temperature to make sure it’s comfortable and warm ensuring it’s not too hot or cold so
your dog is happy. It’s also advisable to use low flow and light water pressure only.<br>

Preparing for the bath is the next step to take. Whether you’re bathing your dog indoors or outdoors,
you should move all your bathing equipment to the desired location in a clean, safe, and reachable area.
While you’re organising everything, do so quietly and calmly so as to not alarm your dog.<br>
If you’re using the bathroom, put the shampoo and conditioner to the side where your free hand will be
(your other hand will be holding onto your dog). Place the towel on a towel rack, away from the water,
and put the treats in your pocket so you can easily get them out when needed. Other tools and equipment
should be within reach of your free hand, but safe from the water.<i class="fa fa-paw "></i> </pre>
